# Definition Tester

This Python program tests you on definitions. It fetches the definition data from a google spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eldaA46CAHHqtJYo_TbSVtDohiAwzzEByYAadaHOdIU/edit?usp=sharing), and tests you in a CLI, when you run _spreadsheet.py_.

* If you want to make your own list of definitions, change client_secret.json.  
* There's also a Google Spreadsheet Macro I made in the link above, that does the same thing but with a better UI.
